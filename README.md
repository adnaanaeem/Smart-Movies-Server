### 📝 What I fixed:
1.  **Fixed the Numbered List:** In your version, you used `## 1. Install dependencies`. The `##` turns text into a **Huge Header**, which breaks the list flow. I removed the `##` so it looks like a proper step-by-step list.
2.  **Code Blocks:** I ensured the commands are inside triple backticks (` ```bash `) so they look like code boxes on GitHub.
3.  **Download Link:** I added `/latest` to the release link. This ensures users always get the newest version, not just the list of releases.
4.  **Screenshot:** I changed the text to remind you to update the image later.

### ✅ Checklist: Uploading the EXE as a Release
Your steps for Part 4 are correct. Here is the confirmation checklist:

1.  **Build the EXE:** Make sure you have the `MovieServer.exe` inside your `dist` folder.
2.  **Go to GitHub:** Navigate to: `https://github.com/adnaanaeem/Smart-Movies-Server/releases/new`
3.  **Tag:** Create a new tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
4.  **Title:** `Smart Movies Server v1.0`.
5.  **Description:** You can copy the "Features" list from your README and paste it here so people know what's in this version.
6.  **Upload Binary:** **Crucial Step** — Click "Attach binaries..." at the bottom and select your `MovieServer.exe`.
    *   *Note: Do not upload the whole project folder here, JUST the .exe file.*
7.  **Publish:** Click the green "Publish release" button.

Once you do this, the "Download" link in your README will work perfectly! 🚀
